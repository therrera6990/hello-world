"Hello, my name is Thomas Herrera. I'm a junior here at Boise State. I decided to go into Computer Science because I've always thought that computers were pretty amazing and that all the coding seemed pretty interesting. When I was about 14 I was able too get enough money and build my own PC. I'm a full time student, but also I work full time as a Correctional Officer here in Kuna, Idaho."
